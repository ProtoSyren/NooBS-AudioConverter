# NooBS Audio Converter

## What's this?

A super small, super fast, super straight forward all in one audio file conversion tool. It uses [ffmpeg](https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg) to handle conversion, so it's rock solid and heavily supported.

## Features

### ‚úÖ Completed Features

- **Convert 1, or all**: Select a single file, or an entire directory.
- **Multiple File Type Support**: mp3, aac, opus, flac, ac3, wma, aiff, alac, and beyond! See the entire list of ffmpeg's supported filetypes [here]() (TODO)
- **Clean, Quick Interface**: 5 clicks from start to finish* <sub>kinda</sub>

### üöß To-Do List

- [ ] **Multi OS support**: I only run windows so it'll be fun to figure out.
- [ ] **Better progress percentages**: ffmpeg is slow at reporting. Unsure if I can fix this.
- [ ] **UI fixes**: Some paddings are off by a px or 2. It'll bother me if it's not fixed.
- [ ] **Performance Optimization**: Eliminate all unnecessary or bloated components
- [ ] **Documentation**: Improve and expand documentation
- [ ] **Testing**: There's none rn.
- [ ] **Internationalization**: Add multi-language support
